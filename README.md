# Zigada - Zig bindings for Ada URL Parser

This repository contains bindings to the `Ada` library, implemented in the Zig programming language. The primary purpose of this project was to learn and explore Zig, so please be aware that the parser may contain bugs or unhandled edge cases.

## Purpose

While this parser offers basic functionality, it is not intended for production use. It serves as an educational tool and a stepping stone for further exploration of Zig.

## Features

- **Bindings to AdaURL**: The parser interfaces with the `Ada` library to handle URL parsing.
- **Learning-Oriented**: This project was developed to understand Zig's syntax, semantics, and performance characteristics.

## Usage

To use the parser, simply clone the repository and build it using Zig. Keep in mind that this is an experimental project, so the implementation may not cover all possible URL scenarios.

```bash
cd zigada
zig build
```

## Notes
- Bugs and Issues: Due to the educational nature of this project, there may be bugs or incomplete features. Contributions and suggestions are welcome but be aware that this project is primarily for learning purposes.
- Further Exploration: Feel free to fork this repository and extend its functionality as you dive deeper into Zig.
